			 * 2. Multiply the member variable offset by 4.
			 *
			 * How to find on Windows:
			 * 1. Find the function's offsets with asherkin's VTable dump.
			 * 2. In IDA Pro, go to the ".rdata" section of the Windows binary.
			 * 3. Search for "Tank::`vftable'" to jump to the "Tank" vtable.
			 * 4. Compare your dump's offsets with asherkin's dump's offsets to find the target function.
			 * 5. Look for the target function in the target binary.
			 * 6. Multiply the member variable offset by 4.
