* [AlliedModeders Post](https://forums.alliedmods.net/showpost.php?p=2750588&postcount=4): Written by me
* Dedicated Server can unlock 8+ or more player slots
* Local listen Server only 8 players and unable to unlock 8+ or more player slots
   - Local listen Server is unstable and easily crash because Sourcemod doesn't support listen server.
* Including 5+ players fix
